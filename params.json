{"body":"### about!\r\n`named-regexp` is a thin wrapper for good ol' `java.util.regex` but with support for named capture groups in Java 5/6. (yes, Java 7 already does this...)\r\n\r\n### snippet.\r\nThe construct for named groups is the same as in Java 7: __`(?<name>...)`__, as shown below.\r\n\r\n```\r\nNamedPattern p = NamedPattern.compile(\"abc(?<foo>\\\\d+)xyz\");\r\nNamedMatcher m = p.matcher(\"abc123xyz\");\r\nif (m.find()) {\r\n    System.out.println(\"found '\" + m.group(\"foo\") + \"'\"); // prints \"found: '123'\"\r\n} else {\r\n    System.out.println(\"nothing found...sorry :[\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### help?\r\nPost a question on [__StackOverflow__](http://stackoverflow.com) and tag it with __named-regexp__.\r\n","name":"named-regexp","note":"Don't delete this file!
