named-regexp 0.2
================

This library is a wrapper for `java.util.regex`, implementing named capture groups for Java 5/6. Note this isn't needed in Java 7, which already supports this feature.

This is a fork of the named-regexp project at:
http://code.google.com/p/named-regexp

This fork fixes several bugs from the original project.
